Symmetrical back-edges

- book/appendixE/hotel-303.als is a good one
    - Key has incoming edges from multiple types: segregate them
    - look at run commands to see only one Room, 3 or 4 cards
    - look at sig declarations to see only one Desk
    - separate out highest cardinality sig (Card)
    - then invert Guest->Card rel cards to keep metamodel visually hierarchical
    - other note: compute ranks for node kinds based on meta-model,
      then layout atoms in lexicographic order within their rank
