COMPLETED
- Project over Existential type inference
- Color by sets
- Express hierarchy with hair
- 

TO BE COMPLETED

- backedges
    - ignore some edges during layout
    - infer back edges / spine
- infer view relations as attributes
- filter atoms by regex or skolem
- consistent placement through projections
- pictures for nodes
- The backedge feature does not work when a model is "Projected". eg. FileSystem
	- Projecting over the file-system Sig in Filesystem presents this problem

- identify dominant shapes: largest list, tree, V, diamond, circle
- identify hetergeneous shapes (i.e., comprise multiple relations)

- minimize edge crossing through edge inversion

- left-right orientation vs top-down orientation

- bi-directional layout
    - consider farmer without projection: put fox and farmer above the
      state row, and grain and chicken below the state row

- Subtyping with Haicuts
	- Getting the possible width and depth of models
	- expanding the shapes vocabulary
- "relative" edge centre based labelling. (visual centre versus, boundary intersection centre)
- for VERY LARGE instances, filter node and edges
- Mouse over highlighting of nodes and edges

Pamela Zave Suggestions:
- circular layout
- bigger arrowheads
- arbitrary node placement
- stability through projection
- seeing multiple frames of a projection
