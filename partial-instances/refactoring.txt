- test harness
- now that + and - are no longer ambiguous, can we:
    - simplify the grammar
    - separate type checking from parsing more cleanly
- can the grammar be made more similar to the book?
- why does Sig extend Expr?
- the implementation of the visitor pattern seems unconventional
- do we have a clear understanding of the module system?
- is the macro system in the main codebase? do we want it there?
- document the threading/vm launching code
- some methods are very large
- ScopeComputer
